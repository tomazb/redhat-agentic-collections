# Federation Request

Guide users through creating a complete federation PR — from gathering module metadata to opening the pull request with the `federation` label. Assumes the user has no prior knowledge of the federation process.

## Prerequisites

**Required Tools**:
- `git` — version control
- `gh` — GitHub CLI for PR creation
- `uv` — Python environment manager (for `/create-collection`)

**Verification**:
```bash
which git >/dev/null && echo "✓ git" || echo "✗ git not found"
which gh >/dev/null && echo "✓ gh" || echo "✗ gh not found — install from https://cli.github.com"
which uv >/dev/null && echo "✓ uv" || echo "✗ uv not found — install from https://astral.sh/uv"
```

**Human Notification Protocol**:
If prerequisites fail:
```
❌ Cannot execute: <tool> not found
📋 Setup: <install instructions>
```

**Security**: Never display credentials. Never clone private repos without user confirmation.

## When to Use This Skill

Use when:
- A user wants to register an external agentic pack in the marketplace
- A user asks how to federate a pack they maintain in another repository
- A user wants to create a PR to add a federated module

Do NOT use when:
- Reviewing an existing federation PR → Use `/federation-review`
- Adding skills directly to this repository → Use `/agentic-contribution-skill`
- Listing or inspecting existing clusters → Use `/cluster-inventory`

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Gather Module Data

Ask the user for each field, one at a time. Explain what each field is and provide examples. Validate each answer before moving to the next question.

**Fields to collect:**

1. **name** (required)
   - Ask: "What is the module name? Use kebab-case (e.g., `partner-network-tools`). This will be the identifier in the marketplace."
   - Validate: kebab-case, 1-64 chars, `a-z0-9-`, no consecutive `--`, no leading/trailing `-`
   - Validate uniqueness: check it does not already exist in `marketplace/rh-agentic-collection.yml`

2. **description** (required)
   - Ask: "Describe the module in 1-2 sentences. What does it do and who is it for?"
   - Validate: non-empty, under 200 characters

3. **version** (required)
   - Ask: "What version is the module? Use semver format (e.g., `1.0.0`, `0.1.0`)."
   - Validate: matches semver pattern `X.Y.Z`

4. **repository** (required)
   - Ask: "What is the Git repository URL? (e.g., `https://github.com/org/repo`)"
   - Validate: valid URL, must NOT be `https://github.com/RHEcosystemAppEng/agentic-collections` (that would be a direct contribution, not federation)

5. **license** (required)
   - Ask: "What license does the repository use? Must be compatible with Apache 2.0. Compatible licenses: Apache-2.0, MIT, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause."
   - Validate: must be one of the compatible licenses

6. **ref** (optional)
   - Ask: "Do you want to pin to a specific commit SHA or tag? Leave empty to use the default branch."
   - If provided, validate format (40-char hex for SHA, or valid tag name)

7. **path** (optional, default: `.`)
   - Ask: "Where is the Lola pack inside the repository? Use `.` if it's at the repo root, or specify a subdirectory path (e.g., `my-pack`)."
   - Default: `.`

8. **tags** (required)
   - Ask: "List tags for discoverability, comma-separated (e.g., `networking, sdn, troubleshooting`). The tag `federation` will be added automatically."
   - Validate: at least 1 tag provided
   - Always append `federation` tag if not already included

**After collecting all fields**, present a summary table and ask for confirmation:

```
## Module Summary

| Field       | Value                                         |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Name        | <name>                                        |
| Description | <description>                                 |
| Version     | <version>                                     |
| Repository  | <repository>                                  |
| License     | <license>                                     |
| Ref         | <ref or "default branch">                     |
| Path        | <path>                                        |
| Tags        | <tag1>, <tag2>, ..., federation               |

Proceed? (yes/no)
```

Wait for explicit user confirmation before continuing.

### Phase 2: Create Marketplace Entry

1. **Action**: Read `marketplace/rh-agentic-collection.yml`
2. **Action**: Append the new federated module entry before the comment block at the end of the file. Use this format:

```yaml
  - name: "<name>"
    description: "<description>"
    version: "<version>"
    license: "<license>"
    repository: "<repository>"
    ref: "<ref>"              # omit this line if no ref was provided
    path: "<path>"
    tags:
      - "<tag1>"
      - "<tag2>"
      - "federation"
```

3. **Output to user**: "Added module entry to `marketplace/rh-agentic-collection.yml`."

### Phase 3: Generate Collection Files

1. **Action**: Clone the external repository to a temporary directory:

```bash
git clone --quiet --depth 1 <repository> /tmp/federation-<name>
# If ref was provided:
cd /tmp/federation-<name> && git fetch --depth 1 origin <ref> && git checkout <ref>
```

2. **Action**: Verify the pack exists at the declared path:

```bash
test -d /tmp/federation-<name>/<path>/skills && echo "✓ Pack found" || echo "✗ No skills/ directory at <path>"
```

If the pack is not found, report the error and ask the user to verify the repository URL and path.

3. **Action**: Create the federation module directory:

```bash
mkdir -p federation/modules/<name>
```

4. **Action**: Invoke the `/create-collection` skill targeting the cloned pack. The skill will generate `collection.yaml` and `collection.json` under `.catalog/`.

   Since `/create-collection` expects the pack to be a local directory registered in the marketplace, work as follows:
   - Point `/create-collection` to the cloned pack at `/tmp/federation-<name>/<path>/`
   - After generation, copy the resulting `.catalog/` contents to `federation/modules/<name>/.catalog/`

```bash
mkdir -p federation/modules/<name>/.catalog
cp /tmp/federation-<name>/<path>/.catalog/collection.yaml federation/modules/<name>/.catalog/
cp /tmp/federation-<name>/<path>/.catalog/collection.json federation/modules/<name>/.catalog/
# Copy any fragment .md files too
cp /tmp/federation-<name>/<path>/.catalog/*.md federation/modules/<name>/.catalog/ 2>/dev/null || true
```

5. **Action**: Clean up the temporary clone:

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/federation-<name>
```

6. **Output to user**: "Generated collection files at `federation/modules/<name>/.catalog/`."

### Phase 4: Create Pull Request

1. **Action**: Create a feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/federate-<name>
```

2. **Action**: Stage all changes:

```bash
git add marketplace/rh-agentic-collection.yml federation/modules/<name>/
```

3. **Action**: Show the user what will be committed:

```bash
git diff --cached --stat
```

4. **Action**: Ask user to confirm the commit. Propose message:
   ```
   feat: federate <name> module from <repository>
   ```
   Wait for explicit confirmation.

5. **Action**: Commit and push:

```bash
git commit -m "<approved message>"
git push -u origin feat/federate-<name>
```

6. **Action**: Create the PR with the `federation` label:

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "feat: federate <name> module" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Federation Request

Adds **<name>** as a federated module from [<repository>](<repository>).

### Module Details

EOF
)" \
  --label "federation"
```

7. **Output to user**: The PR URL and a note that CI validation will run automatically.

### Phase 5: Summary

Present final summary:

```
## Federation Request Complete

| Item                  | Status |
|-----------------------|--------|
| Marketplace entry     | ✅ Added to marketplace/rh-agentic-collection.yml |
| Collection files      | ✅ Generated at federation/modules/<name>/.catalog/ |
| Pull request          | ✅ <PR-URL> |
| CI validation         | ⏳ Will run automatically (federation label applied) |

**Next steps:**
- CI will validate the federated module automatically
- A maintainer will review using `/federation-review`
- Once approved and merged, the module will be installable via `lola install -f <name>`
```

### Required MCP Servers

None — this skill uses CLI tools only.

### Required MCP Tools

None — no MCP tools are invoked.

### Related Skills

- `/create-collection` — generates `.catalog/collection.yaml` and `collection.json` for the federated pack
- `/federation-review` — used by maintainers to validate the resulting PR
- `/agentic-contribution-skill` — for direct contributions (not federation)

## Critical: Human-in-the-Loop Requirements

**MUST confirm before:**

1. **Module data** (Phase 1): Present summary table, wait for "yes"
2. **Commit** (Phase 4): Show staged changes and proposed message, wait for approval
3. **Push & PR** (Phase 4): Confirm before pushing and creating the PR

**NEVER:**
- Push without explicit approval
- Create commits without confirmation
- Skip the summary confirmation in Phase 1
- Proceed if the pack is not found at the declared path
