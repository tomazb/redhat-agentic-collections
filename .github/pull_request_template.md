- [ ] Skills are single-purpose task executors
- [ ] Skills encapsulate all tool access (MCP tools invoked only inside skills)
- [ ] Document consultation: file is **read** with the Read tool, then declared to the user
- [ ] No credentials hardcoded; env vars used via `${VAR}` references
- [ ] Human-in-the-loop confirmation added for any destructive or critical operations

## Validation

- [ ] `make validate` passes locally
- [ ] New/changed skills have valid YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`)
